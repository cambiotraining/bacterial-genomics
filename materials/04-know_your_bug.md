#### Learning Objectives

- Understand that there are different ways to approach your analyses depending on which species you're analysing

:::

Before starting your analysis, it's important to understand the characteristics of the species you're working with as this will determine how best to proceed.  In particular, you need to understand how much genetic diversity or plasticity is present in your bug and whether or not it recombines.  For instance the approach you take to build a phylogenetic tree of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* genomes will differ from the methods you'd use to build a tree with *Escherichia coli*.  To help with making your decision, we've provided a flowchart which outlines the best approach to take depending on what your dataset is composed of:
