## What is nf-core?

nf-core is a community-led project to develop a set of best-practice pipelines built using Nextflow workflow management system.
Pipelines are governed by a set of guidelines, enforced by community code reviews and automatic code testing.

## What are nf-core pipelines?

nf-core pipelines are an organised collection of Nextflow scripts,  other non-nextflow scripts (written in any language), configuration files, software specifications, and documentation hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/nf-core). There is generally a single pipeline for a given data and analysis type e.g. There is a single pipeline for bulk RNA-Seq. All nf-core pipelines are distributed under the, permissive free software, [MIT licences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

## Running nf-core pipelines

### Software requirements for nf-core pipelines

nf-core pipeline software dependencies are specified using either Docker, Singularity or Conda. It is Nextflow that handles the downloading of containers and creation of conda environments. In theory it is possible to run the pipelines with software installed by other methods (e.g. environment modules, or manual installation), but this is not recommended. 

## Usage instructions and documentation

You can find general documentation and instructions for Nextflow and nf-core on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/) . 
Pipeline-specific documentation is bundled with each pipeline in the /docs folder. This can be read either locally, on GitHub, or on the nf-core website.

Each pipeline has its own webpage e.g. [nf-co.re/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/usage).

In addition to this documentation, each pipeline comes with basic command line reference. This can be seen by running the pipeline with the parameter `--help` , for example:

```bash
nextflow run -r 3.4 nf-core/rnaseq --help
```

### Config files

nf-core pipelines make use of Nextflow's configuration files to specify how the pipelines runs, define custom parameters and what software management system to use e.g. docker, singularity or conda.

Nextflow can load pipeline configurations from multiple locations.  nf-core pipelines load configuration in the following order:

![Nextflow config loading order](images/nfcore_config.png)

1. Pipeline: Default 'base' config
* Always loaded. Contains pipeline-specific parameters and "sensible defaults" for things like computational requirements
* Does not specify any method for software packaging. If nothing else is specified, Nextflow will expect all software to be available on the command line.
2. Core config profiles
* All nf-core pipelines come with some generic config profiles. The most commonly used ones are for software packaging: docker, singularity and conda
* Other core profiles are debug and two test profiles. There two test profile, a small test profile (nf-core/test-datasets) for quick test and a full test profile which provides the path to full sized data from public repositories.
3. Server profiles
* At run time, nf-core pipelines fetch configuration profiles from the [configs remote repository](https://github.com/nf-core/configs). The profiles here are specific to clusters at different institutions.
* Because this is loaded at run time, anyone can add a profile here for their system and it will be immediately available for all nf-core pipelines.
4. Local config files given to Nextflow with the `-c` flag
```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.0 -c mylocal.config
```
5. Command line configuration: pipeline parameters can be passed on the command line using the `--<parameter>` syntax.

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.0 --email "my@email.com"`
```

### Config Profiles

nf-core makes use of Nextflow configuration `profiles` to make it easy to apply a group of options on the command line.

Configuration files can contain the definition of one or more profiles. A profile is a set of configuration attributes that can be activated/chosen when launching a pipeline execution by using the `-profile` command line option. Common profiles are `conda`, `singularity` and `docker` that specify which software manager to use.

Multiple profiles are comma-separated. When there are differing configuration settings provided by different profiles, the right-most profile takes priority.

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.0 -profile test,conda
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.0 -profile <institutional_config_profile>, test, conda
```

**Note** The order in which config profiles are specified matters. Their priority increases from left to right.

### Multiple Nextflow configuration locations
Be clever with multiple Nextflow configuration locations. For example, use `-profile` for your cluster  configuration, the file `$HOME/.nextflow/config` for your personal config such as `params.email` and a working directory >`nextflow.config` file for reproducible run-specific configuration.

:::{.callout-exercise}
**Note: As we have already prepared the config file, you can skip this exercise.**

Add the `params.email` to a file called `nfcore-custom.config`

### Running pipelines with test data

The nf-core config profile `test` is special profile, which defines a minimal data set and configuration, that runs quickly and tests the workflow from beginning to end. Since the data is minimal, the output is often nonsense. Real world  example output are instead linked on the nf-core pipeline web page, where the workflow has been run with a full size data set:

```bash
$ nextflow run nf-core/<pipeline_name-profile test
```

:::{.callout-tip}
### Software configuration profile
Note that you will typically still need to combine this with a software configuration profile for your system - e.g.
`-profile test,conda`.
Running with the test profile is a great way to confirm that you have Nextflow configured properly for your system before attempting to run with real data

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues running your pipeline you can you the nf-core  website  to troubleshoot common mistakes and issues [https://nf-co.re/usage/troubleshooting](https://nf-co.re/usage/troubleshooting) .

### Extra resources and getting help

If you still have an issue with running the pipeline then feel free to contact the nf-core community via the Slack channel .
The nf-core Slack organisation has channels dedicated for each pipeline, as well as specific topics (eg. `#help`, `#pipelines`, `#tools`, `#configs` and much more).
The nf-core Slack can be found at https://nfcore.slack.com (NB: no hyphen in nfcore!). To join you will need an invite, which you can get at https://nf-co.re/join/slack.

You can also get help by opening an issue in the respective pipeline repository on GitHub asking for help.

If you have problems that are directly related to Nextflow and not our pipelines or the nf-core framework tools then check out the [Nextflow gitter channel](https://gitter.im/nextflow-io/nextflow) or the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nextflow).


## Referencing a Pipeline

### Publications

If you use an nf-core pipeline in your work you should cite the main publication for the main nf-core paper, describing the community and framework,
as follows:

**The nf-core framework for community-curated bioinformatics pipelines.**
Philip Ewels, Alexander Peltzer, Sven Fillinger, Harshil Patel, Johannes Alneberg, Andreas Wilm, Maxime Ulysse Garcia, Paolo Di Tommaso & Sven Nahnsen.
Nat Biotechnol. 2020 Feb 13. doi: [10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x). ReadCube: [Full Access Link](https://rdcu.be/b1GjZ)

Many of the pipelines have a publication listed on the nf-core website that can be found [here](https://nf-co.re/publications).

### DOIs

In addition, each release of an nf-core pipeline has a digital object identifiers (DOIs) for easy referencing in literature
The DOIs are generated by Zenodo from the pipeline's github repository.
