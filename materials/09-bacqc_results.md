## Learning Objectives

- Use the bacQC results to remove low quality samples from further analyses.

:::

Now that the `bacQC` pipeline has run, we can assess the quality of the sequence data.  At this stage, we want to identify issues such as:

- Any samples that have very low read coverage i.e. less than 10x
- Any samples where the majority of reads were removed during the trimming process
- Any samples that are contaminated with species other than the target.  Typically the threshold for reads assigned to other species will vary depending on what you want to do with the data, e.g. for a *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* dataset, we might aim for a maximum of 20% reads that map to other species

To assess the quality of our sequence data, we can use the outputs generated by **bacQC**.  If you need a reminder of where to find these files, have a look at the [`bacQC` output documentation](https://github.com/avantonder/bacQC/blob/main/docs/output.md).

Open `read_stats_summary.tsv` and try to answer the following questions:

- Were there any samples with a estimated post-trimming coverage less than 10x?
- Were there any samples with a low percentage of reads left post-trimming?

Now, open `species_composition.tsv` and answer this question:

- Do any of the samples contain more than 20% reads that weren't assigned to *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*?

Make a note of any samples you think should be removed from any downstream analyses.  Feel free to discuss this with other participants and compare your results/conclusions to see if you reach similar conclusions.
