## Learning Objectives

- Visualization group exercise - tailor microreact outputs for different audiences.

:::

Presenting your data to different audiences is an important part of being a scientist and you should be able to tailor your research outputs accordingly. For the first group exercise, we're going to use Microreact to design an infographic that displays the data we've been working with that's tailored to one of the following audiences:

- Field epidemiologist
- Head of a public health lab
- Minister of Health
- Concerned citizen

We're going to gather you into approximately the same sized groups based on where you're sitting in the room and assign you one of the audiences to tailor a Microreact display for.  We suggest that one person in each group is responsible for manipulating the Microreact whilst the other members of the group provide useful input. In 30 minutes we'll ask you to nominate a member of your group to do a two minute presentation of the data, remembering that you also need to tailor your presentation to your audience avoiding jargon where appropriate.

Good luck!
