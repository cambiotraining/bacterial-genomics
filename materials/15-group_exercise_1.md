## Learning Objectives

- Discuss how the presentation and visualisation of your results should be tailored to your target audience(s). 
- Use Microreact to customise visualisations accordingly.
:::

Presenting your data to different audiences is an important part of being a scientist and you should be able to tailor your research outputs accordingly. 
In this group exercise, you will use Microreact to design an infographic that displays the data we've been working with.
Your presentation should be tailored to one of the following audiences:

- Field epidemiologist
- Head of a public health lab
- Minister of Health
- Concerned citizen

Participants will be split into groups and assigned one of the audiences. 
We suggest that one person in each group is responsible for manipulating the Microreact, whilst the other members of the group provide useful input. 
After 30 minutes we'll ask you to nominate a member of your group to do a two minute presentation of the data.

Remember: your presentation should be tailored to your audience, avoiding jargon where appropriate.
