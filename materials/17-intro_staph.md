## _Staphylococcus aureus_

_Staphylococcus aureus_ is an important human pathogen that colonises approximately 30% of the population. It is a major cause of multiple infections with varying degrees of severity including skin and soft tissue, bone and joint, endocarditis, device and prosthesis, line-related, pneumonia, and bacteraemia. Mortality from bacteraemia is reported at approximately 30% (Bai 2022) with approximately 14,000 cases from 2022 to 2023 (UKHSA 2023). Antimicrobial drug resistance (AMR) is an important factor in increasing mortality resulting from _S. aureus_ infections; in the global burden of disease study from 2019, _S. aureus_ was the second highest contributing pathogen to AMR related deaths (_Lancet_ 2022). Meticillin resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA) is a primary concern of resistance amongst _S. aureus_ infections and accounted for the pathogen-drug combination, across all bacteria, with the highest attributable deaths, whilst resulting in a higher mortality when compared to methicillin sensitive _S. aureus_ (UKHSA 2023).

Genomic epidemiological studies over last two decades have provided significant insights into the transmission dynamics of _S. aureus_ and aided targeted control strategies. Whole-genome sequences from _S. aureus_ isolates derived from hospitals and the community have provided insights outbreaks related to critical care wards, care homes, intravenous drug user networks, and schools, for example (Harris, 2013, Coll 2017, Marks 2021, van Tonder 2023). It has helped detail the emergence of human-adapted clades, such as CC398, facilitated a one-health approach to understanding transmission, and identified key virulence traits (Young 2012, Uhlemann 2017, Larsen 2022). There is an increasing body of evidence that routine use of whole-genome sequencing can aid infection prevention control and public health decision making, and this is being increasingly investigated and implemented (Durand 2018). That said, there is a significant disparity in sequences generated between regions and an under-representation of sequences from MSSA, which can bias our understanding of the population dynamics and evolutionary selection pressures shaping _S. aureus_ populations.

## Course dataset

For this course we're going to analyse 30 isolates collected as part of a citizen science project that aimed to identify links between self-reported social networks and genome-linked transmission of _S. aureus_ in two Cambridgeshire schools (van Tonder 2023).
