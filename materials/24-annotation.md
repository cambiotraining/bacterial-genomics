## Genome annotation

Genome annotation is a multi-level process that includes prediction of protein-coding genes (CDSs), as well as other functional genome units such as structural RNAs, tRNAs, small RNAs, pseudogenes, control regions, direct and inverted repeats, insertion sequences, transposons and other mobile elements.  The most commonly used tools for annotating bacterial genomes are `Prokka` and, more recently, `Bakta`.  Both use a tool called `prodigal` to predict the protein-coding regions along with other tools for predicting other genomic features such as `Aragorn` for tRNA.  Once the genomic regions have been predicted, the tools use a database of existing bacterial genome annotations, normally generated from a large collection of genomes such as UniRef, to add this information to your genome.
