#### Analysing Pneumococcal genomes with Pathogenwatch

Whilst you can upload FASTQ files to Pathogenwatch, it's quicker if we work with already assembled genomes.  We've provided pre-processed results for the _S. pneumoniae_ data generated with AssembleBAC in the `preprocessed/` directory which you can use to upload to Pathogenwatch in this exercise.
