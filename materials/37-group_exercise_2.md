## Learning Objectives

- Collect and synthesise the findings of a full analysis, to prepare a presentation aimed at different stakeholders.
- Acknowledge that different audiences may have different backgrounds and expectations when learning about your analysis and findings. 

:::

## Final presentation

In this final exercise, you will prepare a 5 minute presentation aimed at one of the following audiences:

- Field epidemiologist
- Head of a public health lab
- Minister of Health
- Concerned citizen

Participants will be split into groups and assigned one of the audiences. 
Feel free to work with any of the four datasets we've worked with this week (including the outbreak). 
Your presentation should include a brief background/introduction, a methods section (remember the Minister of Health may not care which version of TB-Profiler you used!), your results and some interpretation. 

Remember that the presentation should be tailored to your audience.
